# 🎮 AI Based Tic-Tac-Toe & Two Player Chess Game

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes two interactive web-based games:

1. **AI-Based Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT)**
2. **Two Player Chess Game**

The Tic-Tac-Toe game includes AI using the **Minimax Algorithm**, while the Chess game is fully built using JavaScript-based logic and conditions.

# 🧠 1️⃣ AI-Based Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT)

## 🔹 Game Modes

### ✅ Board Sizes:
- 3 × 3
- 4 × 4

### ✅ Difficulty Levels (Available in 3×3 Mode):
- Easy Mode
- Hard Mode (AI Powered)

## 🤖 Minimax Algorithm Explanation

The AI opponent in Hard Mode uses the **Minimax Algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games.

### 🔎 What is Minimax?

Minimax is a recursive algorithm that simulates all possible future moves and selects the best move for the AI.

- The AI tries to **maximize** the score.
- The human player tries to **minimize** the score.

### ⚙️ Scoring System Used:

- AI Win → `+10`
- Human Win → `-10`
- Draw → `0`

### 🔄 Working Process:

1. Check all available empty cells.
2. Simulate AI move.
3. Recursively simulate opponent move.
4. Evaluate board score.
5. Choose move with highest score.

This makes the AI:
- Strategic
- Smart
- Nearly unbeatable in Hard Mode

# ♟️ 2️⃣ Two Player Chess Game

This is a complete two-player chess game built using JavaScript.

## 🔹 Features:

- Complete chess board layout
- All chess piece movement rules
- Valid move verification
- Turn-based system
- Game condition handling
- Real-time DOM updates

The entire game logic is implemented using JavaScript-based conditions and event handling.
